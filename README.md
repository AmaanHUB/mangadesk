## Features ‚ú®

- Login to keep track of your followed manga.
- Keep track of already downloaded manga.
- Download multiple chapters together.
- Searching!
- Responsive UI (kind of)
- Written in Golang :)

Works for Windows/Linux/macOS.

## Usage ‚úç

Simply choose the chapters you want to read to download.

### Download folder

By default, all downloads are stored in a folder titled `downloads`, relative to where you run the application.

However, you can change this by changing the `downloadDir` field in the `usr/usr_config.json` file (this file only
appears after running the application at least once!).

### Languages

By default, English (`en`) is the main language.

You may change your desired language(s) through the `languages` field in the `usr_cofig.json` file.

Please use comma-separated [ISO language codes](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/)!
